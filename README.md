# Express API Project ðŸš†

>For this project, I have used the book API dataset in the data file, and built my very first server using Node.js and Express.

ðŸŒˆEndpoints:

*1.Root: `/`
*2.Books: `/books` (shows first 50 books to prevent delayed response when API loading)
*3.Book ID: `/books/id/(bookID number)`
*4.Author(s): `/books/author/(name)`

*Filtering:*

* By average ranking:

*High: `/books?average_rating=high`
*Low: `/books?average_rating=low`

* By number of pages:

*High volume of pages: `/books?num_pages=lots`
*Fewer pages: `/books?num_pages=few`

* By author:
*`/books?author=author`

* By title:
*`/books?title=title`

## How I went about it

First step to handling the API response was to filter to the first 50 books by using the `.slice()` method, in order to prevent delay in response. By using the `.sort()` method and creating functions, I have used the average rating and the number of pages to iterate through the array of books and display the ones that match the criteria. 

Next, I used the `.filter()` method and applied it similarily to filter both through authors and title. This was slightly more tricky to do, since I had to take in consideration that the user won't always enter the name of the author/title perfectly.
